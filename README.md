This is a tactical missile, don't be fooled

A brief moveset guide:

• Twirl double jump: (A) mid air

• Special floating and redirectable dive: (B) midair after a twirl, ground pound cancelling into it or ground pound landing, and after a groundpound double jump

• Ground pound cancel into double jump: (A) while groundpounding

• Dive slide actions: after landing a dive, (B) to bounce into another dive, (A) to twirl out of a dive, and (Z) to long jump out of a dive, (B) during any long jump makes you dive as well

• Ground pound Land into a high triple jump: (A) after ground pound landing, moving the stick results in a longer triple jump.

• Floaty Ground Pound: Replaces normal gp, gives you a boost upwards, keeps most of your speed. All actions that could be performed out of the GP last time are still possible

• GP Fast fall: *Hold down Z*. Boost downwards while Ground pounding :3 simple as that

• GP land into dive slide: *Z when landing* to immediately enter to the special dive slide, independent of the floor around you.

• Wall bonking wall kick: Has 3 uses, allows you to wall kick out of heavy bonks and not only soft bonks. It's easier to perform :3

• Explosions!!!!1!1!1: Landing a GP, or bonking into walls results in an explosion where you hit. You have 2 iframes so you don't get damaged by your explosion, others will (I think)

• on 1.1.0: New model now more accurate to the latest honi designs :3
